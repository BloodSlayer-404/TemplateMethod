### Introduction:
This is an example of the behavioral design pattern called "Template Method
" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
This example is based on the crafting system of the videogame Genshin Impact, in which you can craft some items and food. This 2 process are very similar to each other, but they have some differences, for this we create a common template, that this 2 subcrafting systems implements, each system can override the part of the template that they use in a different way.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/TemplateMethod/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/TemplateMethod/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
